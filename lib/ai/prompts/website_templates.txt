## Critical Requirements

1. **Responsive Design**: Use Tailwind's responsive breakpoints (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:)
2. **Mobile-First**: Stack content vertically on mobile, expand to multi-column on desktop
3. **Semantic HTML**: Use proper HTML5 elements (header, nav, section, article, footer)
4. **Accessibility**: Include ARIA labels, alt text, and proper heading hierarchy
5. **Performance**: Minimize inline styles, use Tailwind utility classes
6. **Tailwind Only**: DO NOT include custom CSS unless absolutely necessary

## Output Format

Return ONLY valid HTML that can be rendered directly. Structure should be:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>[Business Name]</title>
  <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Your generated website here -->
</body>
</html>
```

## Content Guidelines

- Use the business name, niche, and target audience information provided
