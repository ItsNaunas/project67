## ⚙️ Optional Database Migration

If you want to optimize achievement calculations, run this SQL (optional):

```sql
-- Add regeneration count column (improves performance)
ALTER TABLE public.dashboards 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS regeneration_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0;

-- Create update function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.update_regeneration_count()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  UPDATE public.dashboards
  SET regeneration_count = regeneration_count + 1
  WHERE id = NEW.dashboard_id;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Create trigger
DROP TRIGGER IF NOT EXISTS on_regeneration_created ON public.generations;
CREATE TRIGGER on_regeneration_created
  AFTER INSERT ON public.generations
  FOR EACH ROW 
  WHEN (NEW.type IN ('business_case', 'content_strategy'))
  EXECUTE PROCEDURE public.update_regeneration_count();

-- Backfill existing data
UPDATE public.dashboards d
SET regeneration_count = (
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.generations g
  WHERE g.dashboard_id = d.id 
  AND g.type IN ('business_case', 'content_strategy')
);
```

**Note:** This is optional. The system works correctly without it, but it will improve performance for users with many projects.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: PDF Export Not Working
**Solution:** Make sure you ran `npm install jspdf`

### Issue: Achievements Showing 0 Regenerations
**Solution:** This was fixed! Make sure you pulled the latest dashboard.tsx changes.

### Issue: Keyboard Shortcuts Not Working
**Solution:** Make sure you're not typing in an input field. Shortcuts work when focused on the page.

### Issue: Version History Not Showing
**Solution:** You need at least 2 versions of content. Generate once, then regenerate to see versions.
