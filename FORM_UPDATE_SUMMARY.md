## ✅ New Question Flow (8 questions)

1. **Business Name** - "What's your business name?"
2. **Niche/Industry** - "What's your niche or industry?"
3. **Product/Service** ⭐ NEW - "What product or service do you offer?"
4. **Target Audience** - "Who is your target audience?" (now comprehensive)
5. **Pricing Model** ⭐ NEW - "What's your pricing model?"
6. **Primary Goal** - "What's your primary goal?"

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Run Database Migration:

You need to run this SQL in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Add new columns
ALTER TABLE public.dashboards 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS product_service TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS pricing_model TEXT;

-- Optional: Remove old column (only if you don't need existing data)
-- ALTER TABLE public.dashboards DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS ideal_customer;
```

See `lib/supabase/migration_add_product_pricing.sql` for the full migration file.
